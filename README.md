## About this project

It is a very basic single page app written with Vue. It is only a simple form with few fields (For mask I used `v-mask`, for validation I used `vuelidate`) and It submits to a server written with Laravel (https://github.com/zerokol/userform-backend).

The layout was built with `bootstrap-vue`.

### Setup it with
